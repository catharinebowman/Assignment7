Cohort Description:
There were 5,000 observations in this database, 4810 of which did not have an adverse cardiac event. Approximately 66% of individuals who had a cardiac event reported annual out-of-pocket care costs of >$9950, compared to 21.4% of individuals without a cardiac event documented. The majority of individuals with a cardiac event did not have a history of smoking (59.5%); a finding that was shared with the non-cardiac event group (91.0%). There were more male participants in the cardiac event group than females (90.0%). Finally, the mean age across both cardiac and non-cardiac event groups was approximately 40 years.

Results Overview: 
The results of this investigation revealed that increased annual out-of-pocket costs of care (as defined by categories of the 'cost' variables) were associated with an increased odds of having an adverse cardiac outcome (as defined by the variable 'cardiac'). Specifically, I noted that having annual out-of-pocket care costs between $9800 and $9950 were associated with an odds of adverse cardiac event of 3.57[95% CI 2.01, 6.19] when compared to the reference cost of less than $9800. Furthermore, participants with care costs greater than $9950 had an increased odds of an adverse cardiac outcome of 10.46[95% CI 6.19,17.87] relative to the reference group.
