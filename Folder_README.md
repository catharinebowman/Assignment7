# Data Description
Original Data Repository (forked from): <https://github.com/MethodsForReproducibleHealthResearch/Assignment7.git>

There were 5,000 observations in this database, 4810 of which did not have an incident myocardial infarction. Approximately 66% of individuals who had a myocardial infarction reported annual out-of-pocket care costs of >$9950, compared to 21.4% of individuals without an incident myocardial infarction documented. The majority of individuals with a myocardial infarction did not have a history of smoking (59.5%); a finding that was shared with the myocardial infarction group (91.0%). There were more male participants in the myocardial infarction group than females (90.0%). Finally, the mean age across both myocardial infarction and non-myocardial infarction groups was approximately 40 years.
